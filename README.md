## 🚆 Project Overview

This project is a **Java-based Railway Ticket Booking System** inspired by the real-world *Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC)* platform. The system simulates key functionalities of online train reservation such as user authentication, train search, booking tickets, and viewing booking history.

It was developed as a **major project for my college end-semester dissertation** with a focus on real-world backend development, REST API design, and database integration.
